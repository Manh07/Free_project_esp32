# 🚀 Free ESP32 Project Collection

This repository is a curated collection of free, open-source ESP32-based embedded projects that I've built and shared. It's aimed at helping developers, students, or makers get started quickly with real-world examples, and also to promote my personal brand in the IoT/embedded community.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Open any module folder and read its `README.md` for wiring, dependencies, and usage.
3. Flash the `.ino` file to your ESP32 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
4. Check Serial Monitor for logs and results.

> **Tip:** Each module is self-contained. You can use them independently or as building blocks for your own projects.
